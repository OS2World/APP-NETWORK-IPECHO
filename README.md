APP-NET-IPECHO
============

IPECHO (formerly called MYIP) is a simple TCP/IP utility for querying the current system's IP address as seen from the Internet.

Specifically, IPECHO contacts a special website that reports the IP address of your computer as the remote server sees it. This allows you to determine your public IP address even if you are connecting through a firewall or router that uses network address translation.

IPECHO requires a 32-bit TCP/IP stack (i.e. MPTS 5.3/WR_8600 or higher).
